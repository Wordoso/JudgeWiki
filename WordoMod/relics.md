| ----- | ---- | ------ | ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| ![](relics/Obsidian.png) | Black Diamond | Starter | Wordo_mod_color | Every 3 combats, choose a Curse card to add to your deck. Can be skipped. | A jet black gem, paradoxically as fragile as the soul. |
| ![](relics/Effigy.png) | Incandescent Pearl | Starter | Wordo_mod_color | At the start of each combat, gain #yJudgement. | A perfectly smooth pearl. It's as if light stays trapped inside of it. |
| ![](relics/GasMask.png) | Gas Mask | Rare | Red | When you #yExhaust a card, add 1 point to the counter. When you enter a boss combat, heal that much. | Filter out the dust. |
